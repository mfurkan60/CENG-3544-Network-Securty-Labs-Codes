 # Lab1
 
 
 Raport 
 In this lab session , we examined the linux and bash syntax. During the Lab lesson we were asked to write a bash Script. I created a bash script file using the Kali Linux operating system. The name of the file is: mySpace.sh I determined. The bash script I wrote runs the ls and pwd commands in linux indefinitely. The output of these commands it writes to the file that I set as a.txt.
 
 As a result, I tried to write a bash script for the Linux operating system.
