# LAb-1 
In this lab skin, we examined the linux and bash syntax. During the Lab lesson we were asked to write a bash Script. I, on the other hand, created a bash script file using the Kali Linux operating system. I named the file as: mySpace.sh. The bash script I wrote runs ls and pwd commands in linux indefinitely. It writes the output of these commands to the file I have specified as a.txt.
